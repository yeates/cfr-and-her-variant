# cfr-and-her-variant
CFR(Counterfactual Regret Minimization) algorithm is a important method for solving imperfect information game, and proved to be workable relative to DRL.
this code repo about realization of CFR basic method and related variants.

## already done
TBD

## pancake

* CFR-raw(basic cfr algorithm)
* Monte Carlo CFR
* CFR+
* Linear CFR
* Deep CFR

Actually, I may code other imperfect information method such as NFSP、RPG... sometime
